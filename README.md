# Typinator-CSS
Typinator snippets used to write CSS. You need to type "c" in the quick search to filter (activate) those snippets. 

I don't assign short abbreviations for most of them because I don't use abbreviations. I tend to forget them. For that, my strategy is to simply type the letter "c" on the quicksearch so that all the snippets of the CSS language will show up there. I will then quickly select or further filter them. 

if you want use abbreviations, you can change them to shorter words or phrases.
